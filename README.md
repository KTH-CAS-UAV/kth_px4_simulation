todo:
- [] installing ros indigo + gazebo 7 with mavros, mavlink and SitL-gazebo (px4 addapted rotor simulator)
- [] instruction on how to add difrent sensors to drone model (lidar, RGB(D)-cameras etc.)
- [] instructions on how to build a simple world in gazebo
- [] document with frequent problems + answers (reset of model problem, catkin make to catkin build etc.)
- [] instructions how to run it using multiple computers (Gazebo on gpu) and rest on nuc for example

## gazebo-assets 
todo:
- [] include the simple world files (cage simulation, Daniels maze, etc)
- [] include models of custemized drones (with lidar, d-camera etc)

## ros-nodes 
todo:
- [] teleop node for joystick control
